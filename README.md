### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![WelcomeImage](resources/Juan_Olmedo.png)

I am a Java software developer with a strong background in Spring and Android development. My expertise extends to AWS cloud services, JavaScript, ReactJS, and database technologies including non-relational databases like MongoDB and relational databases like PostgreSQL. My passion lies in building applications that have a meaningful impact on users' lives by improving their quality of life.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring 14 years of experience as an Air Force veteran, where I honed my troubleshooting skills and breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks. This experience has equipped me with a unique perspective and problem-solving approach in the world of software development. I am also proficient in data structures and algorithms, enabling me to create efficient and effective solutions for a wide range of challenges.
